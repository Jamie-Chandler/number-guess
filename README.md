# Guess My Number Game

_Basic 'guess the number' game built in JavaScript using DOM Manipulation._

How it works:

- The game generates a random whole number.
- The user then inputs their guess (whole number)
- The game tells the user that their number was too low / too high.
- The game 'score' decreases by 1 for every incorrect guess
- The user guesses again until the number guessed === the number generated by the game.
- The score is 20 - number of incorrect guesses
- The game logs the users best 'highscore'
